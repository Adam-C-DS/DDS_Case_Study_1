# Comments on missing Style Data:

## n(227) Cedar Creek Brewery Special Release - actually refers to 2 different beers Smoked Cherry Quad and Excelsior (Imperial Milk Stout) - https://www.cedarcreekbrewery.com/special-release-beers maybe average them out? ABV - 9.2 v 9.8,  IBU - 33 v 47, Average 9.5 and 40 

## n(455) Freetail Brewing Oktoberfiesta - Style is Marzen/Oktoberfest - https://www.freetailbrewing.com/our-brews/

## n(946) Four Peaks Kilt Lifter Scottish Ale -  Style is Amber Ale - https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2171/6218/

## n(992) Oskar Blues The Crowler - Doesnt even seem like it is a beer type, just a resealable can. Consider getting rid of it

## n(993) Oskar Blues Can'D AID Foundation is in fact water... just canned like beer for hurricane recovery
